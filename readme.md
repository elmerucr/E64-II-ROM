# E64-II-ROM
## Introduction
[E64-II](https://github.com/elmerucr/E64-II) is a virtual computer system that runs on macOS and linux. It's mainly inspired by the Commodore 64 but implements significant parts of Amiga 500 and Atari ST technology as well. Without any software inside this virtual machine, it wouldn't do much and the software in this repository forms the ROM & Kernel of E64-II.
